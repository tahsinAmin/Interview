**Binary Tree**
When binary tree is represented in an array, index '0' represents the root of the binary tree.

**disjoint Set**

- Call makeSet on all the element
- if we combine 2 different sets with the same rank, then the new root will have one rank higher.
- Rank of non root node doesn't matter

** Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's Algo.**

- A spanning tree of an undirected graph is a sub graph such that all the vertices are connected to each other and then there is n-1 edges in this subgraph where n is the total number of vertices. So basically the subgraph represents a tree.
- What is the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph?
  A minimum spanning tree is a tree, is a spanning tree such that the sum of
  the weight of the edges is minimum.
