**Binary Tree**
When binary tree is represented in an array, index '0' represents the root of the binary tree.

**disjoint Set**
- Call makeSet on all the element
- if we combine 2 different sets with the same rank, then the new root will have one rank higher.
- Rank of non root node doesn't matter
